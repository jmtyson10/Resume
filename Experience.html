      </div>
      <p>I have been in the US Army Reserves for nine years. I have worked in a couple different countries working as the humanitarian arm of the US Army. This work has developed me into a lifelong learner of becoming a better and more effective leader.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leadership</strong>: The military forces you to develop styles of leadership (Authoritarian, Participative...) through working with a melting pot of people with different personalities and backgrounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Effective Communication</strong>: I can convey information in a clear and concise format across diverse personalities.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Study</strong>: I can identify short comings in my skill sets and knowledge base allowing myself to fill those gaps of information.</li>

      </div>
      <p>I started working as a GIS Technician 5 years ago at a water treatment and distribution company. This company did not have a GIS program and did not have GIS data, workflows, and minimal equipment. This afforded me a unique opportunity to be able to build a program/department from the bottom up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Management</strong>: I have developed two and managed three geospatial databases. I built links between all three to be able to produce useful visualizations saving the company time and money. I ensured data quality by developing specific workflows for data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Technologies</strong>: I taught myself how to use and integrate different platforms to increase geospatial productivity including ArcGIS PRO, Collector, WorkForce, SEDARU, Tremble R2 and R1 GNSSs, across different operating systems such as iOS and Android.</li>
        <li><strong>Python and SQL</strong>: I increased efficiency by writing scripts and tools to query data and automate tasks/processes using SQL and Python. I have also used Python to clean, analyze and visualize data for pattern recognition and report building.</li>

      </div>
          <p>I have over 10 years of experience working in the hospitality industry. I have worked the majority of positions from dishwashing to Sous Chef including a bartender. From working in these positions, I have honed a multitude of skills:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: being able to work flexibility in stressful situations.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>: I can read a room within a few minutes and know if what is being said is being accepted.</li>
          <li><strong>Mental Resiliency</strong>: I can understand constructive criticism and apply it to current and future projects.</li>

      </div>
      <p>I studied Public Health as the University of Colorado Denver and earned by baccalaureate of science degree in 2017. The developed the following skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multitasking</strong>: One of the many benefits of being a full-time student in college is learning how to work on multiple projects at once and make deadlines.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Development</strong>: It is not enough to be able to work well with a team. Often you must be able to teach others how to work as a team and use specific individuals' skills to create the best product.</li>
        <li><strong>GIS Platforms</strong>: I clocked over 500 hours working within ArcMap, 100 hours with QGIS, 100 hours with ENVI and other tech. platforms.</li>
